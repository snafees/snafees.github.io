## Hello!

My name is Saba Nafees and I'm a computational biologist, entrepreneur, and lifelong learner.  
- With a background in mathematical biology and bioinformatics, I’m passionate about discovering and applying novel mathematical tools to uncover insights in genomics data. Until recently, I was part of a biotech startup developing a cell-free mRNA diagnostic for Alzheimer’s and before that as a data scientist, doing computational biology and infectious disease work at [Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/). I continue to consult on bioinformatics work, including Nextflow/pipeline development, cloud computing and optimization, gene expression analysis, and mathematical and computational (numerical, machine learning, statistical) approaches to understanding sequence variation connected to disease phenotypes. 

Some of my past and current projects are:

- analyzing patient samples from a hospital setting for viral or bacterial outbreaks
- methods development work which focuses on quantifying sequence-phenotype relationships by developing a mathematical method and software tool to analyze DNA, RNA, and protein sequences and mapping phenotype information onto sequence space (***ortho_seqs***).
- using ***ortho_seqs*** in conjunction with machine learning to analyze and predict synthetic antibodies
- analyzing immune repertoires 
- developing and conducting bioinformatics & metagenomics training for scientists from around the world (working with the Gates Foundation’s Grand Challenges [grantees](https://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/challenge/metagenomic-next-generation-sequencing-detect-identify-and-characterize-pathogens)).


My background:
- I'm passionate about bridging the gap between analytical mathematical+computionatal biology and molecular biology.
- My educational background (and Ph.D.) is in mathematical biology at [Texas Tech University](http://www.ttu.edu/), in good 'ol Lubbock, TX.
- Until recently, I have been [#UndocumentedandUnafraid](https://www.pbs.org/show/dream-me/) and I'm proud to be part of the immigrant rights movement.

Outside of science, it is my passion to help young people, especially immigrant students, pursue their higher education and career dreams. As someone who grew up being undocumented in Texas, the pursuit of higher education and science was a privilege but my path was full of obstacles. It is my life’s mission to help young students pursue their educational dreams, regardless of their socioeconomic or immigration backgrounds.

### Research
[2020 paper in NAR Genomics & Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/2/4/lqaa101/6030984)

For my Ph.D. work, I worked on implementing a novel mathematical tool derived by my advisor, Dr. Sean Rice, that aims to map phenotypes onto underlying sequence space using tensor-based multivariate orthogonal polynomials. I am currently applying this method to other applications in molecular biology but one example that shows this implementation as applied to RNA is given in the paper linked above.

### Software

I'm also currently developing a command line tool written in Python that makes it easier for researchers to utilize the aforementioned approach in their own work.
Update: we now have a GUI that goes along with the CLI!
Read the documentation [here](https://ortho-seqs.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html).
The github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/snafees/ortho_seqs). If you have ideas or comments or would like to contribute, please let me know!

### Relevant Press Related to Advocacy & Other Things!

I was recently awarded the Texas Tech University College of Arts & Sciences Distinguished Alumni Rising Innovator [Award](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/artsandsciences/alumni_friends/news_features/2023_Distinguished_Alumni_News_Story.php). I'm grateful and honored. I'm excited to continue to mentor TTU students as they pursue their higher education goals.

#### STEM & Mentorship
[STEMcx](https://www.stemcx.org/) is a wonderful nonprofit organization that promotes STEM education and resources for students from underrepresented communities based in Baltimore, MD. I had a great time being interviewed by Anaiah, a wonderful young lady who's in the 8th grade and has exciting plans for her career.

#### Documentary
You can find out more about my family's immigration story in this award-winning documentary produced by PBS, [Dream With Me](https://www.pbs.org/show/dream-me/). Note that this is just one of millions of American stories that showcase the undocumented American's struggle. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or would like to screen it at your organization!

I'm humbled to have started the first chapter at Texas Tech after being inspired by my mentor, Jose Antonio Vargas. Within a few years of the founding of the Texas Tech chapter, over 70 chapters were founded at various colleges and universities across the country, highlighting the need for student leadership and involvement around immigrant rights and civic engagement. Though the chapters program was discontinued, I remain as an advisor to the Texas Tech chapter and maintain close contact with student leaders involved with immigrant rights and solidarity work at Texas Tech and other college campuses.
