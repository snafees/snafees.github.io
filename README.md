## Hello! 

My name is Saba Nafees and I'm a young scientist, entrepreneur, and lifelong learner.  
- I'm passionate about bridging the gap between mathematics and biology.
- I recently finished my PhD in mathematical biology at [Texas Tech University](http://www.ttu.edu/), in good 'ol Lubbock, TX.
- Until recently, I have been [#UndocumentedandUnafraid](http://dreamwithmemovie.com/) and I'm proud to be part of the immigration reform movement.
